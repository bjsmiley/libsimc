# Libsimc Progress Journal
## 10/31/18
Just started this journal to record thoughts, opinions, and reflect. Hope it goes well.  
I added more functions to array.h  
More testing needs to be done for them  
including:  
* array_pop(), array_get_head(), and array_overwrite_data() and array_get_new()

Clean up code & comments   
See what can be written better then I would like to finalizing array.h for now  
idea: implement in functions.h time() passing in a func and args and it records execution time...
